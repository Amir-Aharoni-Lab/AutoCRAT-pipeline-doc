# Welcome to AutoCRAT Pipeline Documentation

This guide provides documentation for the **AutoCRAT pipeline** and its supplementary scripts, designed to simplify pipeline results' management and visualization.

## About AutoCRAT

AutoCRAT simplifies complex workflows, enabling you to focus on discoveries instead of processes. It offers automation, ease of use, a modular design, and high performance through multiprocessing.

### Key Design Principles:
- **Fully automated and non-interactive**: Optimized for scalable deployments with minimal user intervention.
- **User-friendly**: Easy to set up and operate.
- **Modular architecture**: Flexible structure for seamless integration and expansion.
- **High performance**: Leverages multiprocessing and pre-compilation for efficiency.

### Core Capabilities:
- **Effortless data import**: Supports microscopy movies in various formats.
- **4D fluorescence dot detection**: Identifies fluorescent dots in movies through advanced statistical analysis.
- **Quantification of dot intensity**: Provides detailed measurement insights.
- **Particle tracking**: Handles challenging low signal-to-noise ratios effectively.
- **Cell identification**: Groups nearby tracks across different channels.
- **Precise 3D measurements**: Calculates distances between fluorescent dots.

### Add-On Module Capabilities:
- **Automated detection of DNA replication timing**: Fully automated and identifies replication times without manual intervention.
- **Replisome-normalized signal averaging**: Delivers detailed quantification.
- **Double-strand break detection**: Identification of double-strand breaks.
